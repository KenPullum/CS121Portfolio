# ProjectFour
Used Lab11 as my starter, added a TestScores Class that uses a method to turn an integer score into a letter grade. Put the letter grades into a linked list for each student, then created a .gradesToString method with a for loop to print the list of letter grades when looking at one student's information (couldn't get it to work for the displayAllStudentInfo method </3 )
